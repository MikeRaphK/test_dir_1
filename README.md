# Fibonacci Implementation
This repository contains implementations of the Fibonacci sequence calculation in C.

### Implementations
- **Recursion**: `fib_rec(int n)` - Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using recursion.
- **Memoization**: `fib_memo(int n)` - Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using memoization.
- **Dynamic Programming**: `fib_dp(int n)` - Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using dynamic programming.

### Usage
Run `fibonacci.c` to see the time taken by each implementation for n=10.
