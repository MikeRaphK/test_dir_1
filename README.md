# Fibonacci Functions

This repository contains implementations of Fibonacci number calculations using different approaches:

1. **Recursive**
2. **Memoization**
3. **Dynamic Programming**

## Fibonacci.c

The `fibonacci.c` file includes three functions to compute the n-th Fibonacci number:
- `fib_rec(int n)`: Calculates Fibonacci using recursion.
- `fib_memo(int n)`: Calculates Fibonacci using memoization.
- `fib_dp(int n)`: Calculates Fibonacci using dynamic programming.

The main function tests these implementations with `n=10` and measures the execution time for each.

## Usage
You can compile the `fibonacci.c` file using a C compiler and run it to see the results.
