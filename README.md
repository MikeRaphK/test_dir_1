# Fibonacci Functions

This project includes implementations of the Fibonacci sequence calculation using different techniques:

1. **Recursion**: `fib_rec(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using recursion.
2. **Memoization**: `fib_memo(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using memoization technique.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: `fib_dp(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using dynamic programming.

## Usage

The main function illustrates how to call each of these functions with `n=10` and prints the time taken for each approach.

## Functions
- `fib_rec(int n)`: Fibonacci by recursion.
- `fib_memo(int n)`: Fibonacci by memoization.
- `fib_dp(int n)`: Fibonacci by dynamic programming.
