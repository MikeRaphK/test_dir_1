## Fibonacci Functions

This section describes the newly added Fibonacci functions implemented in `fibonacci.c` to compute Fibonacci numbers using recursion, memoization, and dynamic programming.
### Fibonacci Functions
Added a new file `fibonacci.c` containing 3 different methods to compute Fibonacci numbers:
1. `fib_rec(int n)`: Recursive approach
2. `fib_memo(int n, int memo[])`: Memoization approach
3. `fib_dp(int n)`: Dynamic programming approach

All methods are tested by calculating the 10th Fibonacci number and measuring execution time.
