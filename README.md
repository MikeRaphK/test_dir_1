# Fibonacci Program

This project includes a program that calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using three different methods:
1. Recursion
2. Memoization
3. Dynamic Programming

A new file `fibonacci.c` has been added that contains implementations of these methods along with a main function to test their performance for n=10.
