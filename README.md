## Fibonacci Functions

Added a new C file `fibonacci.c` that includes:
- A recursive Fibonacci function `fib_rec(int n)`.
- A Fibonacci function using memoization `fib_memo(int n)`.
- A dynamic programming Fibonacci function `fib_dp(int n)`.
- A main function to test all three methods and print execution times.
