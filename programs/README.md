# Fibonacci Program

This program includes three methods to calculate Fibonacci numbers:
1. **Recursive Method**: Uses simple recursion.
2. **Memoization Method**: Uses caching to store previously computed results.
3. **Dynamic Programming Method**: Uses an iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.

## Usage
Compile and run the `fibonacci.c` file to see the performance of each method.

## Performance
The program will print the Fibonacci number for n=10 and the time taken by each method.
