# Fibonacci Program

This program contains several implementations of the Fibonacci sequence calculation:

1. `fib_rec(int n)`: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using recursion.
2. `fib_memo(int n)`: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using memoization.
3. `fib_dp(int n)`: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using dynamic programming.

Each implementation is called in the `main` function with `n=10`, and the time taken for each method is printed.
