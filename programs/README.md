# Fibonacci Program

This directory contains the implementation of Fibonacci sequence calculations using different methods:

- **Recursive**: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using a simple recursive approach.
- **Memoization**: Uses caching to store previously calculated results to optimize performance.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Iteratively calculates the Fibonacci numbers using an array.

## Usage

Compile the `fibonacci.c` file and run the executable to see the results for n=10 and the time taken for each method.
