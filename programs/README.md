# Fibonacci Program

This program contains implementations of the Fibonacci sequence using different approaches:

1. **Recursive** - A simple recursive approach.
2. **Memoization** - An optimized version using memoization.
3. **Dynamic Programming** - An efficient iterative approach.

Each implementation is tested with `n=10` and measures the execution time.
