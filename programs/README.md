# Fibonacci Program

This directory contains the implementation of Fibonacci series calculation using different methods:

1. **Recursion**: `fib_rec(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using recursion.
2. **Memoization**: `fib_memo(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using memoization.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: `fib_dp(int n)` - calculates the n-th Fibonacci term using dynamic programming.

Each method is tested in the `main` function with `n=10`, and the time taken for each method is printed out. 

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
./fibonacci
```
